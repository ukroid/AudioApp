# AudioApp
A simple training app that presents the essential audioplayer functionality (play, pause, stop).
The track the app works with is Burzum - Lost Wisdom.
The play button starts the track from the very launching of the app or after the track is stopped with the stop button.
Also it unpauses the track once it's been paused.
The pause button pauses and unpauses the track.
The stop button stops the track with a possibility to start playing it from the beginning once the play button is clicked.
